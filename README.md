# ADMFourthHomework

# TO do list:

  1. Make a description dataset -calculate tfidf values  
  
  2. Choose optimal k for kmeans(3 or 4 in the information dataset?)
  
  3. Comparison among cluster
      - We expect that both datasets will lead to similar clusters. Is this true?
  4. Find similar clusters
      -Jaccard-Similarity to measure the similarity betweeen the two outputs (information clusters vs description clusters). Return the 3-most similar couples of clusters.
  5. Bonus?
  6. Word cloud of house descriptions
      - wordcloud for each couple of clusters. The words that will be represented are those extracted from the description of the houses that are in the relative couple.
  7. Hash functions-secod part
